        <div class="page-title">Welcome to Ahltee!</div>
        <div class="page-subtitle">The <i>Myst</i> novel change tracker</div>
        <div id="welcome">
            <p><i>Ahltee</i> is the D'ni word for <i>branches</i>. Our purpose is to record and share changes made to
                the (currently three) <i>Myst</i> novels. Anyone can view the changes posted here, but you'll need an
                account to participate. Submissions from registered users must be approved by a moderator before
                displaying publicly.
            </p>
            <p>The information gathered here is organized into <b>Scraps</b>, which are general descriptions of changes
                made. Scraps include a brief summary, the applicable novel, and various tags to make it easier to find
                similar items. You can use existing tags or create your own.</p>
            <p>Scraps also contain <b>Snippets</b>, which show the text exactly as it appears in the novels. When you
                open a Scrap, you'll find one Snippet for every edition of that particular novel.</p>
