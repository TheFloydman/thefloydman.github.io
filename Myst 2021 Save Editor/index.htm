  <div id="introSection">Welcome to the <b><i>Myst</i> (2021) Save Editor</b>, a brower-based program that can edit save files (.sav) for the remake of the video game <i><a href="https://cyan.com/games/myst/">Myst</a></i> released in 2021. I have created a few other game-related resources that you can view <a href="https://thefloydman.github.io/">here</a>.<br><br>To begin, click the <i>Choose File</i> button, and locate the save file you would like to edit. Once you open that file, this page will automatically fill with variables to play with. When you are finished, press <i>Save</i>, and a new file will be saved to your download folder.<br><br>This editor does not manipulate save files directly. Instead, when you click <i>Save</i>, a new file is downloaded to your download folder. You will need to copy that file into the appropriate save folder. I highly recommend you keep a backup of any save file you plan to replace, just in case.<br><br>If there is a variable you would like to edit that is not displayed here, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=IAmTheFloydman">contact me on reddit</a>.</div>
