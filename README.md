# Floydman's Projects

Just a few apps I'd like to share publicly without hosting my own website. Consider it my JavaScript showcase, if you will. View live at https://thefloydman.github.io/.

Please be advsied that some parts of this repo are older/outdated and are not accessible from the front page.
