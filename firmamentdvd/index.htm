            <div class="box-sub bar-above">Are you someone who helped crowdfund <i>Firmament</i> through Kickstarter
                or Fangamer
                at the <b>Limited
                    Edition Box</b> level or above? Would you like to have a DVD or Blu-Ray copy of the game as part of
                your physical box? Then this is the project for you!</div>
            <div class="box-sub">Before we get into the details, I want to make it clear I am a big Cyan fan. I think
                the game studio and its employees and contractors are good people who are good at what they do, and I
                understand why they
                chose not to include a physical disk with their physical box. At the same time, I am still disappointed
                a physical disk wasn't included because I place more value in having a physical version of the game as
                opposed to not. This project is neither meant to defame nor inflame, but to fill a gap.</div>
            <div class="box-sub">There are two parts to this project: compression and a label. The
                former is only necessary if you wish to fit the installer on a single DVD&plusmn;R DL (DVD&plusmn;R9)
                disk. That's a dual layer DVD. If you are using a Blu-Ray disk, compression isn't necessary.</div>

            <div class="box-sub bar-above">Compressing your installer is straightforward but a bit lengthy. For
                reference, I'm using an Intel Core i5-9400 CPU with 32 GB of RAM, and compression took about 1.5 hours,
                while decompression from the DVD took about 20 minutes. Add disk burning time to that.</div>
            <div class="box-sub"><b>Please note:</b> I highly recommend running this tool only on the official offline
                GOG
                installer. This project does not generate a custom installer, and the official one will ensure you end
                up with all the correct dependencies.</div>

                        <li>Open README.txt and follow the instructions to create a compressed archive.</li>

            <div class="box-sub bar-above"><b>Explanation</b></div>
            <div class="box-sub">There are three steps to this whole process: precompression, deduplication, and
                compression.</div>
            <div class="box-sub"><i>Precompression</i> is done by XTool. It decompresses anything it can in the hope
                that we can compress those parts better in a later step. This will result in an archive about twice as
                large as your original installer.</div>
            <div class="box-sub"><i>Deduplication</i> is the job of SREP. It finds and removes redundant data. This
                reduces the size of the precompressed archive by about 25%.</div>
            <div class="box-sub"><i>Compression</i> is performed by 7-zip and is exactly what you're accustomed to: A
                compression algorithm (LZMA2 in this case) is used to reduce the size of the deduplicated archive as
                much as possible, resulting in an archive about 60% smaller than the original.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="heading">Label</div>
            <div class="box-sub bar-above">These images have a resolution of 300 DPI based on a label diameter of 4.6562
                in (11.826748 cm) with a bleed of 0.0625 in (0.15875 cm). Artwork will look great with either a small or
                large hole in the center. Right-click an image to save.</div>
